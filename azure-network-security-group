A network security group, or NSG, allows or denies inbound network traffic to your Azure resources. Think of a network security group as a cloud-level firewall for your network.

For example, notice that the VM in the web tier allows inbound traffic on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). This VM's network security group allows inbound traffic over these ports from all sources. You can configure a network security group to accept traffic only from known sources, such as IP addresses that you trust.
